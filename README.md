This repository contains PaddlePaddle implementation of our ICCV 2019 paper (for oral presentation): [Learning Combinatorial Embedding Networks for Deep Graph Matching.](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Wang_Learning_Combinatorial_Embedding_Networks_for_Deep_Graph_Matching_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)

It contains our implementation of following deep graph matching methods: 

- [ ] **GMN** Andrei Zanfir and Cristian Sminchisescu, "Deep Learning of Graph Matching." CVPR 2018.
- [ ] **PCA-GM** Runzhong Wang, Junchi Yan and Xiaokang Yang, "Learning Combinatorial Embedding Networks for Deep Graph Matching." ICCV 2019.

This repository also include training/evaluation protocol on Pascal VOC Keypoint and Willow Object Class dataset, inline with the experiment part in our ICCV 2019 paper.

## Extra requirements
paddlepaddle-gpu==2.1.0
